          "RepairMeasures": "Brace and gusset are severely damaged with significant loss in stiffness and resistance, and both likely require replacement. Yielding and local buckling of beams and columns may be repaired by heat straightening, stiffeners or reinforcement, if there is no cracking or tearing. If cracking or tearing has initiated more substantial repair is needed."
